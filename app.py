#### TO DO:######
# build out functions for:
#     * formatting input into document retrieval query (spaCy)
#     * document retrieval based on query (wikipedia library)
#     * document postprocessing into passages
#     * ranking passage based on BM25 scores for query (rank_bm25)
#     * feeding passages into RoBERTa an reporting answer(s) and passages as evidence
# decide what to do with examples

### CAN REMOVE:#####
    # * context collection

This app demonstrates the answer-retrieval capabilities of a fine-tuned RoBERTa (Robustly optimized Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.

Please type in a question and click submit.  When you do, a few things will happen:
1. A Wikipedia search will be performed based on your question
2. Candidate passages will be ranked based on a similarity score as compared to your question
3. RoBERTa will search the best candidate passages to find the answer to your question

If the model cannot find the answer to your question, it will tell you so.

* [Click here](https://huggingface.co/etweedy/roberta-base-squad-v2) to visit the Hugging Face model card for this fine-tuned model.
* To create this model, the [RoBERTa base model](https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) was fine-tuned on Version 2 of [SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad_v2), a dataset of context-question-answer triples.
* The objective of the model is "extractive question answering", the task of retrieving the answer to the question from a given context text corpus.
* SQuAD Version 2 incorporates the 100,000 samples from Version 1.1, along with 50,000 'unanswerable' questions, i.e. samples in the question cannot be answered using the context given.
* The original base RoBERTa model was introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) and [this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/roberta).  Here's a citation for that base model:
